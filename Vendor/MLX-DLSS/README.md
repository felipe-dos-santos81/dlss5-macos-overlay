Run NVIDIA's DLSS neural rendering and frame generation on images and video.
Apple Silicon uses MLX and Metal; PyTorch supports other GPUs and CPUs.

This is an experimental port, not a game integration or an NVIDIA product.
Bring your own NVIDIA libraries to extract weights. No vendor binaries or
weights are included or downloaded.

## Choose a mode

| Mode | Runtime | Preview |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS app | Swift, Metal, AVFoundation | Live settings; select a video frame on the timeline |
| Web UI | Python, NiceGUI; native Metal media or PyTorch/FFmpeg | Live settings and video timeline |
| CLI / Python API | Native Metal or PyTorch | File output |

On macOS 26+, the web UI uses the same native preview and media pipeline as
the app. Other platforms use the portable Python pipeline.
`mlxdlss-web --native` is a separate pywebview wrapper and still needs Python.

## macOS quick start

Requires Apple Silicon, macOS 26+, Xcode with Swift 6.2+, CMake and Ninja.

```sh
scripts/build-native-app.sh
open '.build/MLX DLSS.app'
```

Choose your [prepared weights](#weights), import media, adjust settings and
start the queue. The app includes its CLI and Metal library. It needs no Python
or FFmpeg at runtime.

Temporal rendering is on by default. Live preview uses up to three preceding
frames; export uses the full sequence and applies frame generation. Native
video output is SDR 8-bit; PNG/TIFF stills retain 16-bit output.

Experimental [super resolution 2×](docs/super-resolution.md): DLSS SR for video,
RTX VSR for images. Both support live preview and require separate model files.

## Weights

Initial extraction uses Python 3.10+:

```sh
python3 -m pip install ./python
mlxdlss-weights all nvngx_dlssnr.dll weights/
mlxdlss-weights extract-fg libnvidia-ngx-dlssg.so.310.7.0 weights/framegen.safetensors
```

Supported sources: `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` version **310.8.0.0** and frame generation
from **DLSS SDK 310.7.0**. `mlxdlss-weights sha256 FILE` checks the DLL build.

Outputs: `NeuralRendering.dlssmodel` for Metal,
`dlssnr-weights-logical.safetensors` for PyTorch and `framegen.safetensors` for
either backend.

## CLI

The app build also creates `.build/release/mlxdlss`:

```sh
.build/release/mlxdlss process-image in.png --output out.png --model weights/NeuralRendering.dlssmodel
.build/release/mlxdlss process-video in.mp4 --output out.mp4 --model weights/NeuralRendering.dlssmodel
.build/release/mlxdlss process-video in.mp4 --output out.mp4 --framegen-weights weights/framegen.safetensors --factor 2
.build/release/mlxdlss process-video in.mp4 --output out.mp4 --sr-model weights/dlss-sr.srmodel
```

Combine `--model` and `--framegen-weights`; `--order nr-fg|fg-nr` selects their
order. Video defaults to temporal rendering, automatic optical flow, H.264 and
audio. Existing output files are preserved. [More options and APIs](docs/embedding.md#native-media-and-live-preview).

| Rendering control | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--profile` | `standard` | `standard`, `natural`, `cinematic`, `neutral` |
| `--processing-scale` | `1` | More detail at higher cost; range 1–4 |
| `--detail-strength` | `1` | Strength of fine changes; range 0–8 |
| `--colour-strength` | `1` | Strength of broad colour changes; range 0–4 |
| `--intensity` | `1` | Overall effect strength; 0 bypasses it |

## Web and Python

Requires Python 3.10+. FFmpeg/ffprobe serve portable video and comparisons:

```sh
python3 -m pip install './python[web,video]'
mlxdlss-web                       # http://127.0.0.1:8181
```

Set weights and backend in **Settings**. Preview images or a selected video
frame while adjusting controls. Export batches with NR/FG in either order,
FG ×2–16, slow motion, H.264/HEVC/ProRes, audio and frame ranges. Jobs support
cancel, retry and downloads; the output folder is configurable.

On macOS 26+, **Upscale 2×** uses RTX VSR for images and DLSS SR for video.
Configure their model files in Settings; preview and export share the Metal path.

Temporal is on for new videos. Preview uses up to three preceding frames;
frame generation runs on export. Saved jobs retain their settings.

![Web panel with temporal preview and export controls](docs/assets/web-video.png)

For the web's Metal backend (image/tensor APIs support macOS 14+):

```sh
swift build -c release
scripts/prepare-mlx-metallib.sh "$(swift build -c release --show-bin-path)"
```

Repeat after a clean build to place `mlx.metallib` beside the binary.
For custom FFmpeg filters, RGB16 video, PyTorch, Core ML conversion and the
Python API, see the [Python guide](python/README.md).

## Accuracy and speed

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Neural rendering vs NVIDIA | 0.004–0.005 MAE on 1152–1408 px game renders |
| Frame generation vs NVIDIA | 59.9 dB PSNR; maximum difference 3/255 |
| Native temporal video, M2 Max | 18.4–20.1 input frames/s |

The video sample has 228 frames at 512×384, detail strength 2: **11.33–12.36 s**
including startup, motion, decode and encode. Desktop load affects timings.
